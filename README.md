Hello! Welcome to TBA Partner, my 2016 winter break project.

# Intro

For those of you who do not ballroom dance, a bit of introduction may be needed.
This app is created first to help me learn Rails and other web things, but
also to help those without ballroom partners find people to dance with at
area competitions. Traditionally, those who do not have partners going into
a comp are said to be "dancing TBA", or dancing with a partner to be announced,
hence the name of the app. Take a look around! I hope you enjoy.

# The technical things

This is a Ruby on Rails app, nothing special really. To run the server, first
be sure you have Rails and SQLite installed and this repo downloaded.
In the highest level directory of this repo, run "bundle install",
then "rake db:migrate", then "rails s". In theory, that should be it!
